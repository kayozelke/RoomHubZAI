# RoomHubZAI

This is an undisclosed fork of the [RoomHub](https://github.com/kayozelke/RoomHub) repository. 

The purpose of this fork was to improve response times at RoomHub application. The optimisation work was the author's task for the course (named 'Web Applications Managment') in the master's degree studies.

Works done were described at "Raport - ZarzÄ…dzanie aplikacjami internetowymi.pdf" (available only in polish).
